# WHOAMI CHAT

Welcome to WHOAMI, a simple web chat application! This project was an exciting journey for me as I delved into the world of ReactJS and the Socket.io library with Redis as a primary database.
It's a fun and straightforward chat application that allows users to connect on a global channel and chat with each other. Let's check out the highlights!
